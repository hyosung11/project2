# Fundamental Human Movements for Kids

## 1. Introduction

Originally, I wanted to create a training app for myself to track my daily sessions. Then I realized, it would be more useful to make something for more people. As a father of two young children I want to encourage them to be active and live a healthy lifestyle full of fundamental human movements daily.

## 2. User Stories
  1. This app is designed to help parents and caregivers promote an active lifestyle with their children and charges.
  1. By training in the fundamental human movements daily, kids will learn to love their bodies and enjoy the fruits of being active for the rest of their lives.
  1. This app introduces the fundamental human movements with images, explanations and examples and will also allows user to keep training log in future version.

## 3. Approach Taken
I want to solve the problem of too much sedentary activity via electronic devices of modern children. With an informative and visually appealing website, I hope to encourage children to get and stay active.

## 4. Technologies Used
Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and EJS

## 5. Unsolved Problems
  1. creating user accounts and passwords
  1. storing and updating training data
  1. visual discrepancies
  1. Actual good content regarding the different movements as well as an introduction to the site and to the different pages.

## 6. Notes
- I need to plan better in breadth and depth, so that as I code I can follow a master plan (building the cathedral) rather than hacking away at section after section and realizing I don't have the proper structure in place.
- I should consider using a framework to style as I ended up running out of time to bring CRAP design to the site.
- I need to test smaller pieces more frequently.
- I suffered from YAGNI.
